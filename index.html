         Philadelphians will never, I mean never, stop celebrating winning SuperBowl 52 in 2018. Seas of people crowded 
         the streets; climbing street lights, swinging from traffic lights, chanting "E-A-G-L-E-S" nonstop.
         After this the "Philly Special" became a well known play in the NFL. 

         Let's not forget the time Philadelphia Sixers' fans booed Beyonce's girl group Destiny's Child at the 2001 NBA Finals..

      Yes, we are talking  about the Philadelphia cheesesteak in this article. Many Philadelphians have different opinions
      about which place makes the best Philly cheesesteak. A few places will be on every Philadelphians list: Max's Steaks, Pat's King of Steaks, Geno's Steaks, Tony Luke's,
      Delassandro's, and Chubby's Steaks. However as every Philadelphian knows the best steaks come from the local corner stores. Check out this video by local foodie JL Jupiter:
